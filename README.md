One more thing to do is to start maildev.  

First of all you have to install npm (node package manager) - it will be necessarily to start React application later on.  
.then() =>   
follow this tutorial and install maildev globaly and start it in project directory




### **Frontend:**  
Go to project directory in terminal and run ,,npm install" it may take a while so don't worry.  
When installation process is finished run ,,npm start" - here you go, you can start using application :D


### **Browser:**  
Unfortunately we have issues with CORS policy and did not manage to fix it.  
So you have to run you chrome browser using win+R and typing "chrome.exe --user-data-dir="C://Chrome dev session" --disable-web-security".

Really sorry about that, will fix it later :c
